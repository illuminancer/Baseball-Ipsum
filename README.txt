I love using different flavors of ipsum just for the heck of it:

http://baconipsum.com

But I was suprised that there wasn't a Baseball Ipsum yet!  So here it is.

Also, I didn't see any ipsum "engines" for C#, so now there will be one.

Roadmap:
-Web interface (similar to Bacon Ipsum)
	-specify desired number of paragraphs
	-option to force start with "Baseball ipsum dolor sit amet"?
	-a decent layout and design (nothing too fancy)
-REST API (maybe? anyone use these for Ipsums?)
