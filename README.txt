I love using different flavors of ipsum just for the heck of it, like:

http://baconipsum.com
http://star-wars-ipsum.herokuapp.com/

But I was suprised that there wasn't a Baseball Ipsum yet!  So here it is.

Also, I didn't see any ipsum "engines" for C#, so now there will be one.

Roadmap:
-Add more baseball terms to words.txt
